<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<p><strong>his recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.</strong> It has been adapted from a number of
    different recipes that I
    have read over the years.</p>

<p><u>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.</u></p>

<p>
    <q>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
        chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
    </q>
</p>

<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
    made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>
<!--
<p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
